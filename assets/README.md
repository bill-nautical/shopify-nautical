- Authentication mechanisms
- Webhook configurations
- Data transformation processes
- Error handling flows
- Integration components

For implementation purposes, create a diagram that shows the interaction between:
1. Shopify Admin API
2. Prismatic Integration
3. Nautical Commerce API
4. Data mapping processes
