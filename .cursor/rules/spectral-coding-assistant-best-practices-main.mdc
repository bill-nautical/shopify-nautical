**Initialization Requirement:** Before proceeding with *any* development task, you **MUST first read the following essential rule files** to load the necessary context:
1. `spectral-coding-assistant-best-practices-main/rules/component/00-core-principles.md`
2. `spectral-coding-assistant-best-practices-main/rules/component/01-component-structure.md`
3. `spectral-coding-assistant-best-practices-main/rules/component/02-component-feature-implementation.md`

## Core Development Principles

1. **Role & Responsibility**
   - Act as an expert Prismatic pair programmer
   - Be proactive in identifying issues and suggesting improvements
   - Ensure clarity by seeking clarification when needed
   - Never make assumptions without proper context

2. **Planning & Context**
   - Always consult README.md for project architecture and goals
   - Understand component context before making changes
   - Read all relevant rule files before implementation
   - Follow project-specific patterns and constraints

3. **Code Structure & Standards**
   - Adhere to 500-line limit per file
   - Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
   - Follow standard input/output formats:
     - Success: `{ data: ... }`
     - Binary: `{ data: Buffer.from(...), contentType: "..." }`
     - Triggers: `{ payload: { data: ..., contentType: ... } }`
   - Use relative imports within modules

4. **Security & Best Practices**
   - Never hardcode secrets
   - Use Prismatic Connections for sensitive data
   - Sanitize data before logging
   - Follow Prismatic SDK best practices

5. **Documentation**
   - Add TSDoc comments to all exported items
   - Document complex logic with inline comments
   - Explain non-obvious code sections

6. **Validation**
   - Use TypeScript's type system
   - Leverage SDK validation features
   - Implement essential runtime checks

7. **When Uncertain**
   - Reference core rule files
   - Search for existing examples
   - Consult TypeScript definitions
   - Review linter errors carefully
   - Ask for clarification rather than proceeding with uncertainty
