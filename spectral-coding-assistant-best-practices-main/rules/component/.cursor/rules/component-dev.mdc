**Initialization Requirement:** Before proceeding with *any* development task described below, you **MUST first read the following essential rule files** to load the necessary context:
1.  `rules/component/00-core-principles.md`
2.  `rules/component/01-component-structure.md`
3.  `rules/component/02-component-feature-implementation.md`

*Failure to read these files before starting is a violation of protocol.*

## 1. Core Principles Adherence
- Always follow the principles detailed in the **already-read** `rules/component/00-core-principles.md`.

1. BEFORE implementing ANY Prismatic-specific structure (connection, action, trigger, etc.):
   - First read ALL relevant sections in the reference files above
   - Search for existing examples in the codebase using the same pattern
   - Consult TypeScript definitions for the specific structure
   - Review linter errors carefully as they indicate required structure

2. When uncertain:
   - Reference the three core rule files again for guidance and follow any pre-requisite readings.
   - Prefer explicit code examples from the codebase over assumptions
   - Always refer to https://prismatic.io/docs for documentation help with spectral SDK
   - Never make assumptions, always ask for clarification if you're unable to determine the answer yourself based on the rules provided
   - Stop and request clarification rather than proceeding with uncertainty
   - ALWAYS assume you are operating in the context of a Prismatic environment
   - Never hallucinate
